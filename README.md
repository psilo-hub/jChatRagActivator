# jChatRagActivator
Helper project for my jChatRag app - generator for activation codes

My [jChatRag](https://github.com/psilo-hub/jChatRAG) app asks the user for an activation code on the first start or when the old one is expired. This app generates those. As I don't want to disclose the password I used, you have three options if you want to try the [jChatRag](https://github.com/psilo-hub/jChatRAG) app:

1. Remove the activation check code in the jChatRag app. That's probably the fastest option.
2. Change the hardcoded (obfuscated) password in both apps to generate activation codes.
3. Ask me for an activation code.
